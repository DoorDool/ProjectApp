# ProjectApp

An app for a group of friends.

The idea is to make an app where every person in the group can create an account linked to a groups name.
In this app you can pick a date for a holiday or something like that.
And there is an option to fill in what you have payed an how many. So this app calculate which friend has to pay to who.

So there must be a screen for:
  -login
  -register
  -date saver
  -pay
  
Login screen:
  Username and password. With check for correct password.
  
Register screen:
  Username with check of username already exists, two times password with check of password is correct.
  Name of friends group.
  
Date saver screen:
  Choose data, what to do, where. Then maybe a popup for every person in that group that you have to set when you are available.
  Choose the best date.
 
Pay screen:
  One screen for to fill in that a person have paid.
  A screen to show how many people have to pay and for who.
